# Weatherapp
This is an app that allows a user to search for current weather conditions by city name, zip code, or coordinates (GPS, reverse geolocation).<br>
For this particular app it only allows the user to search current weather conditions by city only.<br>
Currently working to see if I can add more features<br>

# Tools
IDE: Pycharm<br>
Language: Python<br>
API: https://openweathermap.org/api

# Instructions
This app should be able to run on any IDE with a python extension.<br>
To run the app simply execute it with respect to your choice of IDE.<br>
The app with start and you'll be asked to press enter afterwards you'll then be asked to enter the city.<br>
If the city is found within the API then it will show the current weather data for that location.<br>
